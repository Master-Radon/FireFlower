Hi!
Just few rows, you need to place the extracted directory (called FireFlower), with every of these 4 files, in the /home/ directory of your pc. You can then, after complete the setup, use the program by launching "python3 firepy.py"
or you can call "fireflower" from the terminal, if the setup.sh ends well. If there is an issue, you can contact me!
