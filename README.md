Hi!
Just few rows, you need to place the extracted directory (called FireFlower), with every of these 4 files, in the /home/ directory of your pc. You can then, after complete the setup, use the program by launching "python3 firepy.py"
or you can call "fireflower" from the terminal, if the setup.sh ends well. If there is an issue, you can contact me!

Hi User!
This is an easy software to manage your Linux's Firewall. It allows you to create new rules, delete old ones, check the current status and lots of other features! It's still in beta, so some error may occours, but you can signal them to me and i'll fix that. It works only on Linux! based on UFW and iptables;
NB: This is a tool very easy to use, so it doesn't have every options of iptables. Soon i'll add the rules for IP address and group of ports and protocols. 
This is still a beta!
